## Technologies Used

The Messenger Clone project leverages a modern technology stack to deliver a robust and efficient real-time messaging application. Here are the key technologies utilized:

1. **Next.js:**
   - Next.js is employed for building a React-based web application with server-side rendering and efficient page routing. Its simplicity and extensibility make it a suitable choice for this project.

2. **Prisma:**
   - Prisma is utilized as the database toolkit, providing a type-safe and auto-generated query builder for interacting with the MongoDB database. Its ease of use and compatibility with Next.js make it an excellent choice for managing database operations.

3. **MongoDB:**
   - MongoDB serves as the database to store and retrieve data related to users, messages, and group communications. Its flexible schema and scalability are beneficial for a dynamic messaging application.

4. **Headless UI:**
   - Headless UI components are integrated to enhance the user interface with accessible and customizable components. This ensures a smooth and responsive user experience throughout the application.

These technologies collectively contribute to the development of a feature-rich and scalable Messenger Clone, providing a solid foundation for real-time messaging and user interaction.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
